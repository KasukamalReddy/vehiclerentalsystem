# Vehicle Rental System 🚗

A simple Java application that simulates a vehicle rental service using core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## 📌 Features

- Add, view, and manage different types of vehicles (Car, Bike, Truck, etc.)
- Rent and return vehicles
- Track vehicle availability
- Clean, modular code structure for scalability

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- **Abstraction** – Defined common behavior for vehicles using abstract classes or interfaces  
- **Inheritance** – Created specific vehicle types by extending a base class  
- **Encapsulation** – Protected internal data using private fields and public methods  
- **Polymorphism** – Managed different vehicle types through a common interface or base class

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java
- Console-based interface (can be extended to GUI or web)
- No database (in-memory management using collections like ArrayList)

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Integrate GUI using JavaFX or Swing  
- Add file or database storage (e.g., SQLite, MySQL)  
- Include user authentication and billing module
